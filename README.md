# WebGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API. It can render interactive 2D and 3D graphics on almost any browser. It makes use of the GPU to process the images and content we are going to render, this makes it a lot easier and faster.

WebGL programs consist of code written in JavaScript and shader code written in GLSL (Open GL Shading Language) that is similar to C or C++.

## Content

On this repository you'll find three examples about creating a figure, they are on the `src` folder. They represent three possible stages of creating a figure: 2D version, adding an animation and 3D version.

The slides of our presentation are inside the `slides` directory.

## Examples:

* [First example: 2D Star](ejemplo1.html "2D Star")
* [Second example: 2D Animated star](ejemplo2.html "2D Animated star")
* [Third example: 3D Animated star](ejemplo3.html "3D Animated star")
